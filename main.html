    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    
    <p>Time complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science that describes the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of its input size. Efficient algorithms have lower time complexity, ensuring faster execution for large inputs.</p>
    
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires as a function of its input size. It is crucial to optimize algorithms for better performance, often measured using Big-O notation, such as O(n).</p>
